				<h2>30 Tech Tips: Using Software, Hardware, Data, and AI to get a running start at home, on the road, or in the office.</h2>
					<p class="indent"><strong>2023 Maryland State Bar Association Legal Summit</strong></br>
					Ranging from the basics to recently emerging tech ‚Äì this one-hour program was designed to provide lawyers and legal services staff with valuable tips and information about technologies (including those that are free or nearly free) to work or play more efficiently and effectively. </br>
					The program included a special focus on artificial intelligence, to develop a basic understanding of what AI includes, consider different types of AI technologies relevant to the practice of law, and discuss the boundaries between the work of humans and the machines they devise.</p>
				
				<h2>Finding Maryland Legal Forms</h2>
					<p class="indent"><strong>2023 MLA/DLA Conference</strong></br>A patron walks up to the information desk and says, ‚ÄúI need a form to file with the court so they‚Äôll review my case,‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy ex got a new job with more money, how do I find a form to get my child support changed?‚Äù Do you get questions like these? Confused about what to tell the patron and what information to give them? Some legal actions in Maryland have official forms, but many do not. This can make figuring out what to give your patron a challenge. This session will provide an overview of what might be considered a form, where to find forms, where to find guidance for people trying to fill out or construct a form, and much more.  </p>
