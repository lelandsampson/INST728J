 <h2>Project Overview </h2>
 
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">The web is full of proprietary platforms that invite users to create profiles and content. In the professional sphere, the canonical example of a private platform designed to host identity profiles is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linked In</a>. I currently have a profile there that serves as my professional online presence. Some years ago, for the class LBSC 671, I purchased the domain <a href="http://sampson.info">sampson.info</a> (that URL currently points to the class project for that class). For this class, I plan to build a professional looking website to act as my canonical professional online presence using that domain. The overall goal is for this site is to act as a CV.</p>
