 <h2>Brief self description including job and hobbies </h2>
 
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Hello, my name is Leland, but I go by Lee for short. My pronouns are he/him/his. I work in Annapolis at the Thurgood Marshall State Law Library. I am the Head of Web Content and Services at the Library and my primary responsibility is managing the <a href="https://www.peoples-law.org">People's Law Library website</a>. People's Law provides plain language summaries of the law, instructional articles, a clinic calendar, and legal services directory.  I also provide reference services 4-8 hours per week. About 70% of our reference workload comes from public patrons, the rest is spent serving judges and the Bar. </p> 
	
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">I live in Odenton with my wife, two kids, and two dogs. My children, Gideon and Julia, are ages 6 and 3, so they keep me very busy when I'm not at work or school. My hobbies include building Legos, playing golf, and gardening. We recently built two raised garden beds around two trees in our front yard. We have enjoyed teaching Gideon and Julia about planting and caring for flowers and vegetables. They love to be outside, and it's fun to be active.</p>
	
	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">I'm also an attorney and I worked at various places within the Judiciary while going to law school at night. In the future, I would like to continue to work at a government or possibly academic law library.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 50px;">Because of my day job I do have some experience with HTML and CSS, though mostly in the context of a content management system (the People's Law Library website is built on Drupal). For this class, I am excited to work on a personal portfolio website to have a web presence that I alone manage and control.</p>
