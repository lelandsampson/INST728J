A. Please explain web server, web browser, url.

	Answer: A web server is an Internet connected computer that hosts files and listens for requests for those files. A web browser is software running on the client computer that asks the server for files. The client browser uses the Uniform Resource Locator to tell the web server what files it wants. By entering a URL into a browser, the user tells the browser where to find the server, and what files to ask the server to send.

B. What is difference between html and http?

	Answer: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a specification for formatting data to allow a web browser to interpret and display the content. Users typically encounter HTML by asking a web server for a webpage. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is the most common protocol that web browsers use to contact web servers. HTTP includes commands that servers and clients use to establish connections, ask for data, and send data. 
	
C. What is the usage of page structure tags (<html>, <head>, <body>)? Can you work without them?

	Answer: HTML tags are necessary to tell the browser how to display the content. The <html> tag tells the browser that the data in the file is structured in the HTML format and should be interpreted as such. The <head> tag provides metadata to the browser, including language, page title, style sheets to use, and what scripts are also needed to render the page correctly. The data contained in the <head> tag is not rendered on screen by the browser. The <body> tag contains all the data that is displayed by the browser during the rendering process. Modern web browsers can often render files in many formats such as .txt, .pdf, etc. For example, a modern browser can open this text document and display the data on screen. From what I gather in reading the HTML specification (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#introduction), the only mandatory tag in an HTML document is the <html> tag. 

D. What is <title> tag used for?

	Answer: The <title> tag is a metadata tag used in the <head> that tells the browser what the page's title is. This title is not rendered on the page but is usually displayed in the browser chrome. 

E. Can you identify difference between <div> and <p> tag when styling a page?

	Answer: The <p> tag declares a paragraph of text. A <div> tag is a container element and can be used to specify the formatting of nested html tags. Usually the head on a page will contain a link to a cascading style sheet that defines the style to be used in the div container.

F. Provide tags for different levels of headings that HTML support?

	Answer: <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> 
	
G. Joe is a potential Fall 2019 UMD student. He wants to submit his application files to UMD
admission website. Draw a diagram to illustrate how Joeâ€™s machine communicates with UMD 
website to return UMD admission page.

	Answer: Please refer to the PDF submitted along with this text document. Additionally, I want to add that the illustration is very rudimentary. Looking at the source code of a modern web page reveals it is making tens or hundreds of other hmtl connections each time a request is made. Additionally, the UMD admission page is a dynamically assembled page. The URL appears to use the Craft CMS. Craft is a PHP application running in a web server connected to a database. When the http request comes in from Joe's computer the Craft CMS dynamically creates the html for the page and sends it to Joe's computer.
